### p-value
The way the p-value was calculated is by log-rank test.
Documentation of the way Chi2 was calculated can be found in this file:
- Kaplan_Meier_Analysis.pdf

And are based on this book:
Kleinbaum, D. G. (1998). Survival analysis, a self‐learning text. pg. 82. 

The method for the Kaplan Meier calculation needs to be downloaded separately from:
